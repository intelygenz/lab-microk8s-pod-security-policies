# 5. Modify kubeconfig files to use secure servers

As we have enabled the `kube-apiserver` to be executed in safe mode *(https)*, we have to modify the configuration files generated in previous steps so that they can communicate with the cluster through the https api endpoint. You have to:

- Modify the `.kube-default-sample-psp-conf` and `.kube-default-kube-system-conf` files replacing `server: http://:8080` to `server: https://kubernetes:8443`.

Now you should have the following outputs:

```bash
$ grep 8443 .kube-*
.kube-default-kube-system-conf:    server: https://kubernetes:8443
.kube-default-sample-psp-conf:    server: https://kubernetes:8443
```

## Test RBAC permissions

We have activated RBAC, we have generated two different configuration files. One of them (`.kube-default-kube-system-conf`), with cluster-admin permissions. The other one (`.kube-default-sample-psp-conf`), with permissions limited to a namespace.

To test that RBAC is working correctly, we can execute the following commands:

```bash
$ KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/.kube-default-kube-system kubectl get nodes
NAME     STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
pc1282   Ready    <none>   24h   v1.13.2
$ KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/.kube-default-sample-psp-conf kubectl get nodes
Error from server (Forbidden): nodes is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:sample-psp:default" cannot list resource "nodes" in API group "" at the cluster scope
```
